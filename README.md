# C-Sharp-Projects
These are some small projects I made using C# and .NET Framework
<h2>Projects:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Car Insurance</li>
	<li>Twenty One</li>
</ul>
<h3>Car Insurance</h3>
<p>
	This project is an MVC web application that mimics a car insurance website. It takes user's
	input on policy information and calculates a quote based on business logic. Ther is also an
	admin page that allows staff to view all of the quotes that have been issued.

<h3>Twenty One</h3>
<p>
	This project is a classic game of Twenty One or BlackJack. The program takes in user input such
	as a name, amount of money the user has, and the amount the user wants to bet. Cards are dealt and
	the user is given the option to hit or stay. After each round, the user's amount of money is updated and
	they are given the choice to play again or exit the application.
